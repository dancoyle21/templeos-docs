# TempleOS - Documentation

The documentation for how to use TempleOS and HolyC are burried within the
operating system. This repository aims to be a one stop shop to search for the
topics and documentation required to get you started.

As I explore TempleOS and HolyC, I will add to these docs.

There should be a [quickstart](./QUICKSTART.md) for getting proficient enough
to navigate around the operating system to explore on your own.
